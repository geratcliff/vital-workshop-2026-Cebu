Cost-effectiveness analysis is relevant when healthcare alternatives\n    between different services/interventions have DIFFERENT costs AND\n    varying health consequences EXAMPLE: Different types of

compared to an alternative.\n\n(3) In other words, THE PRICE PER UNIT BENEFIT of one intervention over\n    the other\n\n(4) We have 2 full classes on ICERs in the coming weeks & how to\n    interpret these ratios across interventions What we will focus on\n    TODAY is the components that make up the numerator (i.e. COSTS) &\n    the denominator (i.e. BENEFITS)\n\n(5) WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE - By estimating the magnitude of health\n    outcomes and costs of interventions, cost-effectiveness analyses can\n    show the trade-offs involved across interventions AND THEREFORE,\n    hopefully

performing the surgery and time\n    involved, post-surgery length of stay, re-admission rates) <br> <br>\n\n3.  **Value** -- Apply unit costs to each resource category (e.g.,\n    salary scales from

the volume of service use\n    -   Example: Downstream costs (e.g., hospitalization due to opioid\n        overdose)\n\n-   **Ingredients-based approach (P x Q x C)**\n\n    -   Probability of

tests, hospital bed, provider\n    time, imaging tests, equipment used, etc.)\n\n(2) Gross-costing: Usually what we have to quantify \"downstream costs\"\n    -- but we can also use this approach for costing out an intervention\n    if we don't have the data for the micro-costing approach.\n\n-   For example, if we know that 10 total knee replacements cost us\n    \\$300,000 last month, that's
