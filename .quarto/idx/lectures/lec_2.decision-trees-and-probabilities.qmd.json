There are different levels of risk aversion &\n    there are different decision philosophies for these behaviors\n\n(2) Mini-max regret philosophy essentially means that you would never go\n    to the beach unless there was 0% rain\n\n-   For instance, physicians may be risk averse & therefore minimize max\n    regret\n:::\n\n## Decision Philosophies {auto-animate=\"true\"}\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\nMaximizing expected value is a reasonable criterion for choice given\nuncertain prospects; though it does not necessarily promise the best\nresults for any

Maxi-max gain is the reverse -- where you would always go to the\nbeach unless there was 100% rain -- you are risk seeking -- you love the\nbeach so much that you're going to give it a try.\n\n(3)(b) Another example of this in a medical context -- is the desperate\npatient example -- you're going to die anyways, so we are going to give\nyou this treatment, but it has nasty side effects -- cancer --\nchemotherapies -- even bone marrow transplants, 2nd or third line -- a\nhigh probability of bad outcome but if you do nothing then you're going\nto die.\n:::\n\n## Decision Philosophies

Expected utility\n    -   Depends on the weather.\n\n::: notes\n(4) If you're going to base your decision on expected utility, then your\n    decision depends on the weather & how much value you give to certain\n    outcomes -- this is the rationale thinker approach -- how much you\n    value sitting at home weighed by the utility loss of not having the\n    beach experience, for example.\n:::\n\n## Payoffs\n\n::: incremental\n-   Each state of the world is assigned a cost or outcome.\n-   Our goal is often to calculate the expected value of these payoffs.\n-   We'll cover more on the theories and frameworks underlying various\n    payoffs in the next few lectures\n:::\n\n# Strengths/limitations of decision trees\n\n## Strengths\n\n::: incremental\n-   They are easy to describe and understand\n-   Works well with limited time horizon\n-   Decision trees are a powerful framework for analyzing decisions and\n    can provide rapid/useful insights, but they have limitations.\n:::\n\n## Limitations\n\n::: incremental\n-   No explicit accounting for the elapse of time.\n    -   Recurrent events must be separately built into model.\n    -   Fine for short time cycles (e.g., 12 months) but we often want\n        to model over a lifetime.\n-   Difficult to incorporate real clinical detail - Tree structure can\n    quickly become complex.\n:::\n\n## Preview of
