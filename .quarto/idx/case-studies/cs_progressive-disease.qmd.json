The disease begins mild (i.e., the patient has the disease but experiences very little effects) but can progress to a more severe state that substantially increases the likelihood of death. Individuals also experience mortality from other causes---though in our model, we will separately track deaths from the disease vs. other background causes.\n\nA state transition \"bubble\" diagram of the model you will build is shown below:\n\n![](images/clipboard-792250022.png)\n\n## Policy Decision Problem\n\nSuppose there is a new preventive measure that can be undertaken to reduce the likelihood of disease progression. There is also a more expensive treatment option for individuals with progressive disease. This treatment reduces the probability of death from disease, and slightly increases quality of life in the progressive disease state.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has empowered your team to conduct an economic evaluation to investigate the costs and benefits of the status quo (i.e., do nothing) vs. adopting one of the following strategies:\n\n1.  Implement the lower-cost disease progression prevention strategy. This strategy costs less per person but only reduces the likelihood of disease progression.\n2.  Implement the higher-cost treatment strategy. This strategy costs more per person, but it reduces the probability of death from disease and also raises quality of life with the disease.\n\n# Model Parameters\n\nRelevant model parameters are

|\n+---------------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n# Status Quo Scenario\n\nYour first objective is to build a status quo or \"do nothing\" strategy based on the description and parameters defined above. **This is a strategy in which neither preventive measures nor additional treatments are used.**\n\nTo get you going, we have built out the beginnings of a model based on an alive-dead model with age-specific background mortality rates. You can download this model at [this link](https://graveja0.github.io/vital-istanbul-2024/case-studies/cs_progressive-disease_blank.amua). The image below shows the structure of this model:\n\n![](images/clipboard-2678783669.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Add Health States and Transitions\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Add in the relevant health states and transitions for the progressive disease model. Don't worry yet about transition probabilities and other parameters---just get the Markov structure complete.**\n:::\n\n-   When you reach the end of the branch, select the chance node you would like to turn into a state transition, right click, select Change to State Transition. This will give you the blue arrow <img src=\"../amua-images/arrow_48.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> . On the right of this arrow, you can find a dropdown menu with the different health states you specified. Select the health state this part of the cohort will transition to.\n\n-   With this button <img src=\"../amua-images/alignRightSelected_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> you can align the end nodes.\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIt is common practice in teaching decision modeling to model events sequentially. Suppose, for example, that an individual can experience the following events from a diseased state:\n\n```         \n-   Die from disease (Event A)\n-   Die from background causes (Event B)\n-   Survive\n```\n\nThe image below shows two alternative approaches to modeling these events. **Panel A** uses a non-sequential approach in which events in a cycle are not conditional on other events not occurring. **Panel B**, by comparison, first considers death from Event A. Conditional on surviving A, it then considers death from Event B.\n\n![](images/branching-options.png)\n\nIf you are converting rates to probabilities using standard formulas (e.g., $1-\\exp(-r)$) you should use a sequential approach where only two events are considered at at time (Panel B). This ensures that the converted probabilities work correctly.\n\nIf you are using transition probabilities derived from embedding the transition probabilities from the underlying transition rate matrix, as we covered in lecture, you do not need to undertake the sequential approach: you can use the approach in Panel A, though you will also need to make sure that your model structure captures all non-zero probabilities in your transition probability matrix.\n\n**For the remainder of this case study we will model the disease progression using the sequential approach (e.g., the approach in Panel B).**\n:::\n\nYour Markov model should now look like this:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3516082028.png)\n\n## Define Transition Probabilities\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Use the parameter values above to define and add transition probabilities to the Markov model.**\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nFor this exercise, you will need to define some parameter tables and variables that draw on age-based transition probabilities, just as you did for the alive-dead model. For these transition probabilities, remember to enter them as Variables rather than Parameters. Refer to the [Alive-Dead case study](case-studies/cs_markov_alive-dead.qmd) for instructions on how to index a transition probability to the current age in the model.\n\nBecause transition probabilities are not defined for each age in the model, you will need to specify the \"Truncate\" option in Amua when defining the table. This will allow Amua to draw on the next closest age when assigning the transition probability. A screenshot for a table defined for the disease onset probabilities is shown below.\n\n![](images/clipboard-140813940.png)\n:::\n\nAfter inputting the transition probabilities, your Markov model should look like this:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3556452658.png)\n\n### Sanity Check: Life Expectancy\n\nIt's often useful to occasionally stop and validate that your model does not have any errors in it before moving on to the next step. For this sanity check, let's verify that we can obtain the same life expectancy as in the simple alive-dead model. In other words, we'll allow people to cycle among the various healthy and diseased health states. However, we will (temporarily) rule out the possibility of disease-related death. By calculating life expectancy as the primary outcome, we \"reward\" all health states (healthy, mild, progressive disease) with a payoff value of 1.0. Thus, even though our model is more complicated, we should obtain the same overall life expectancy value as a simple alive-dead model.\n\nTo do this, make the following changes:\n\n1.  Make sure that the life expectancy \"payoff\" (\"LE\") is set to 1 for all health states in which an individual remains alive (Healthy, Mild, Progressive).\n\n2.  Temporarily set the probability of disease-related death (`p_death_disease`) to 0.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nWith these changes made, check and run the model. You should obtain a life expectancy value of 77.0449.\n:::\n\n## Define Outcomes\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nMake sure you set the transition probability for disease-related death back to `0.15`!\n:::\n\nOur next step is to define our primary health-related quality-of-life and cost outcomes.\n\n-   Go to Model {{< fa arrow-right >}} Properties {{< fa arrow-right >}} select the Analysis tab.\n\n-   Add outcomes for costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE)\n\n-   Change the Analysis type to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and define the relevant Cost and Effect outcomes.\n\n-   Make sure to also set the Baseline Strategy to the Status Quo (we'll add more strategies later).\n\n-   You can also add in a Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) threshold of \\$50,000/QALY.\n\n![](images/clipboard-3624159652.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"450\"}\n\n-   Next, in the model itself, define the following cycle-specific payoffs based on the values in the tables above. Many of these parameters are already defined for you in the parameters tab in the Amua model:\n\n    -   Costs and QoL in Healthy state\n\n    -   Costs and QoL in Mild state\n\n    -   Costs and QoL in Progressive Disease state\n\n    -   QoL in Death states\n\n-   **You will also need to define some one-time costs.** For example, death from disease carries a one-time cost (`c_death_disease`). We will add this cost by assigning a one-time cost at the time an individual transitions to the Death (Disease) state from the Progressive disease state. You can add this one-time cost by *right-clicking* on the transition node <img src=\"../amua-images/arrow_48.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> after \"Dead (Disease)\" in the Progressive Disease health state, and then clicking on <img src=\"../amua-images/cost_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Add Cost.\n\n    ![](images/clipboard-1326740867.png){width=\"1000\"}\n\n## Define Cycle Adjustments and Discounting\n\n-   Go to Model {{< fa arrow-right >}} Properties {{< fa arrow-right >}} select the Markov tab.\n-   Select the \"Half-Cycle Correction\" option.\n-   Select the \"Discount Rewards\" option and enter the discount rates shown in the tables above. You can enter a value of 0 for discounting of life expectancy values.\n-   Click \"OK\"\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Now run the model and verify that it calculates expected costs and QALE for the status quo strategy!**\n:::\n\n# Treatment and Prevention Strategies\n\nOur next objective is to build out the remaining two strategies: prevention and treatment. Fortunately, we have already done most of the work to add them -- we just need to copy and paste the Status Quo strategy, then adapt with additional parameters as needed.\n\n### Prevention Strategy\n\n-   Right click on the <img src=\"../amua-images/markovChain_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Markov symbol next to the Status Quo strategy name, then select \"Copy\"\n\n![](images/clipboard-2195549954.png)\n\n-   Right click on the red square and select \"Paste.\" This will create a copy of the Status Quo strategy. Hit the OCD button to organize things again.\n\n-   Rename the new strategy to \"Prevention\" and add in the cost of the prevention strategy—these costs apply to everyone in the mild disease state.\n\n    ![](images/clipboard-1900536045.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n-   Adapt the transition probabilities using the prevention strategy parameters defined in the tables above (and in the Amua model parameters).\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nThe prevention and treatment parameters (`rr_prevention` and `rr_treatment`, respectively) are defined as relative risks. Recall that relative risks can be directly multiplied with transition probabilities:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3957116279.png)If these parameters were instead hazard ratios, we'd have to go back to the underlying transition rates to perform the multiplication, and then re-convert into transition probabilities.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nWith these changes made, check and run the model. Do you obtain different cost and QALE estimates for the prevention strategy?\n:::\n\n### Treatment Strategy\n\n-   Right click on the <img src=\"../amua-images/markovChain_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Markov symbol next to the Status Quo strategy name, then select \"Copy\"\n\n-   Right click on the red square and select \"Paste.\" This will create a copy of the Status Quo strategy. Hit the OCD button to organize things again.\n\n-   Rename the new strategy to \"Treatment\" and adapt the transition probabilities using the prevention strategy parameters defined in the tables above (and in the Amua model parameters).\n\n    -   Make sure to multiply `p_death_disease` by the relative risk reduction *each time it appears in the branches!*\n\n-   Update the utility payoff for the progressive disease state using `u_progressive_treated`\n\n-   Include the one-time treatment cost at the time of transition from mild to progressive disease (see below)\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nThe treatment strategy includes a one-time treatment cost, which should apply as soon as the patient transitions from mild to progressive disease status. You can add this one-time cost by *right-clicking* on the transition node <img src=\"../amua-images/arrow_48.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> after \"Progressive Disease\" in the Mild health state, and then clicking on <img src=\"../amua-images/cost_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Add Cost.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nCheck and run the model to obtain Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) results\n:::\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf the Ministry of Health uses a \\$25,000/QALY threshold for adoption, what strategy would you recommend based on your initial results?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf the Ministry of Health uses a \\$50,000/QALY threshold for adoption, what strategy would you recommend based on your initial results?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf the Ministry of Health uses a \\$100,000/QALY threshold for adoption, what strategy would you recommend based on your initial results?\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nlibrary(downloadthis)\n## Link in Github repo\ndownload_link(\n  #link = \"https://graveja0.github.io/cea-workshop-vital/case-studies/cs5_healthy-sick-dead_v1_BLANK.xlsx\",\n  link = \"https://graveja0.github.io/vital-istanbul-2024/case-studies/cs_progressive-disease_blank.amua\",\n  button_label = \"Download Case Study Template\",\n  button_type = \"primary\",\n  has_icon = TRUE,\n  icon = \"fa fa-save\",\n  self_contained = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis case study will build a decision model to analyze strategies to prevent and treat a noncommunicable disease.\n\nFor this hypothetical disease, individuals start off healthy and can develop a progressive disease.

|\n+---------------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n# Status Quo Scenario\n\nYour first objective is to build a status quo or \"do nothing\" strategy based on the description and parameters defined above. **This is a strategy in which neither preventive measures nor additional treatments are used.**\n\nTo get you going, we have built out the beginnings of a model based on an alive-dead model with age-specific background mortality rates. You can download this model at [this link](https://graveja0.github.io/vital-istanbul-2024/case-studies/cs_progressive-disease_blank.amua). The image below shows the structure of this model:\n\n![](images/clipboard-2678783669.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Add Health States and Transitions\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Add in the relevant health states and transitions for the progressive disease model. Don't worry yet about transition probabilities and other parameters---just get the Markov structure complete.**\n:::\n\n-   When you reach the end of the branch, select the chance node you would like to turn into a state transition, right click, select Change to State Transition. This will give you the blue arrow <img src=\"../amua-images/arrow_48.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> . On the right of this arrow, you can find a dropdown menu with the different health states you specified. Select the health state this part of the cohort will transition to.\n\n-   With this button <img src=\"../amua-images/alignRightSelected_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> you can align the end nodes.\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIt is common practice in teaching decision modeling to model events sequentially. Suppose, for example, that an individual can experience the following events from a diseased state:\n\n```         \n-   Die from disease (Event A)\n-   Die from background causes (Event B)\n-   Survive\n```\n\nThe image below shows two alternative approaches to modeling these events. **Panel A** uses a non-sequential approach in which events in a cycle are not conditional on other events not occurring. **Panel B**, by comparison, first considers death from Event A. Conditional on surviving A, it then considers death from Event B.\n\n![](images/branching-options.png)\n\nIf you are converting rates to probabilities using standard formulas (e.g., $1-\\exp(-r)$) you should use a sequential approach where only two events are considered at at time (Panel B). This ensures that the converted probabilities work correctly.\n\nIf you are using transition probabilities derived from embedding the transition probabilities from the underlying transition rate matrix, as we covered in lecture, you do not need to undertake the sequential approach: you can use the approach in Panel A, though you will also need to make sure that your model structure captures all non-zero probabilities in your transition probability matrix.\n\n**For the remainder of this case study we will model the disease progression using the sequential approach (e.g., the approach in Panel B).**\n:::\n\nYour Markov model should now look like this:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3516082028.png)\n\n## Define Transition Probabilities\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Use the parameter values above to define and add transition probabilities to the Markov model.**\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nFor this exercise, you will need to define some parameter tables and variables that draw on age-based transition probabilities, just as you did for the alive-dead model. For these transition probabilities, remember to enter them as Variables rather than Parameters. Refer to the [Alive-Dead case study](case-studies/cs_markov_alive-dead.qmd) for instructions on how to index a transition probability to the current age in the model.\n\nBecause transition probabilities are not defined for each age in the model, you will need to specify the \"Truncate\" option in Amua when defining the table. This will allow Amua to draw on the next closest age when assigning the transition probability. A screenshot for a table defined for the disease onset probabilities is shown below.\n\n![](images/clipboard-140813940.png)\n:::\n\nAfter inputting the transition probabilities, your Markov model should look like this:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3556452658.png)\n\n### Sanity Check: Life Expectancy\n\nIt's often useful to occasionally stop and validate that your model does not have any errors in it before moving on to the next step. For this sanity check, let's verify that we can obtain the same life expectancy as in the simple alive-dead model. In other words, we'll allow people to cycle among the various healthy and diseased health states. However, we will (temporarily) rule out the possibility of disease-related death. By calculating life expectancy as the primary outcome, we \"reward\" all health states (healthy, mild, progressive disease) with a payoff value of 1.0. Thus, even though our model is more complicated, we should obtain the same overall life expectancy value as a simple alive-dead model.\n\nTo do this, make the following changes:\n\n1.  Make sure that the life expectancy \"payoff\" (\"LE\") is set to 1 for all health states in which an individual remains alive (Healthy, Mild, Progressive).\n\n2.  Temporarily set the probability of disease-related death (`p_death_disease`) to 0.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nWith these changes made, check and run the model. You should obtain a life expectancy value of 77.0449.\n:::\n\n## Define Outcomes\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nMake sure you set the transition probability for disease-related death back to `0.15`!\n:::\n\nOur next step is to define our primary health-related quality-of-life and cost outcomes.\n\n-   Go to Model {{< fa arrow-right >}} Properties {{< fa arrow-right >}} select the Analysis tab.\n\n-   Add outcomes for costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE)\n\n-   Change the Analysis type to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and define the relevant Cost and Effect outcomes.\n\n-   Make sure to also set the Baseline Strategy to the Status Quo (we'll add more strategies later).\n\n-   You can also add in a Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) threshold of \\$50,000/QALY.\n\n![](images/clipboard-3624159652.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"450\"}\n\n-   Next, in the model itself, define the following cycle-specific payoffs based on the values in the tables above. Many of these parameters are already defined for you in the parameters tab in the Amua model:\n\n    -   Costs and QoL in Healthy state\n\n    -   Costs and QoL in Mild state\n\n    -   Costs and QoL in Progressive Disease state\n\n    -   QoL in Death states\n\n-   **You will also need to define some one-time costs.** For example, death from disease carries a one-time cost (`c_death_disease`). We will add this cost by assigning a one-time cost at the time an individual transitions to the Death (Disease) state from the Progressive disease state. You can add this one-time cost by *right-clicking* on the transition node <img src=\"../amua-images/arrow_48.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> after \"Dead (Disease)\" in the Progressive Disease health state, and then clicking on <img src=\"../amua-images/cost_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Add Cost.\n\n    ![](images/clipboard-1326740867.png){width=\"1000\"}\n\n## Define Cycle Adjustments and Discounting\n\n-   Go to Model {{< fa arrow-right >}} Properties {{< fa arrow-right >}} select the Markov tab.\n-   Select the \"Half-Cycle Correction\" option.\n-   Select the \"Discount Rewards\" option and enter the discount rates shown in the tables above. You can enter a value of 0 for discounting of life expectancy values.\n-   Click \"OK\"\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n**Now run the model and verify that it calculates expected costs and QALE for the status quo strategy!**\n:::\n\n# Treatment and Prevention Strategies\n\nOur next objective is to build out the remaining two strategies: prevention and treatment. Fortunately, we have already done most of the work to add them -- we just need to copy and paste the Status Quo strategy, then adapt with additional parameters as needed.\n\n### Prevention Strategy\n\n-   Right click on the <img src=\"../amua-images/markovChain_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Markov symbol next to the Status Quo strategy name, then select \"Copy\"\n\n![](images/clipboard-2195549954.png)\n\n-   Right click on the red square and select \"Paste.\" This will create a copy of the Status Quo strategy. Hit the OCD button to organize things again.\n\n-   Rename the new strategy to \"Prevention\" and add in the cost of the prevention strategy—these costs apply to everyone in the mild disease state.\n\n    ![](images/clipboard-1900536045.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n-   Adapt the transition probabilities using the prevention strategy parameters defined in the tables above (and in the Amua model parameters).\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nThe prevention and treatment parameters (`rr_prevention` and `rr_treatment`, respectively) are defined as relative risks. Recall that relative risks can be directly multiplied with transition probabilities:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3957116279.png)If these parameters were instead hazard ratios, we'd have to go back to the underlying transition rates to perform the multiplication, and then re-convert into transition probabilities.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nWith these changes made, check and run the model. Do you obtain different cost and QALE estimates for the prevention strategy?\n:::\n\n### Treatment Strategy\n\n-   Right click on the <img src=\"../amua-images/markovChain_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Markov symbol next to the Status Quo strategy name, then select \"Copy\"\n\n-   Right click on the red square and select \"Paste.\" This will create a copy of the Status Quo strategy. Hit the OCD button to organize things again.\n\n-   Rename the new strategy to \"Treatment\" and adapt the transition probabilities using the prevention strategy parameters defined in the tables above (and in the Amua model parameters).\n\n    -   Make sure to multiply `p_death_disease` by the relative risk reduction *each time it appears in the branches!*\n\n-   Update the utility payoff for the progressive disease state using `u_progressive_treated`\n\n-   Include the one-time treatment cost at the time of transition from mild to progressive disease (see below)\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\nThe treatment strategy includes a one-time treatment cost, which should apply as soon as the patient transitions from mild to progressive disease status. You can add this one-time cost by *right-clicking* on the transition node <img src=\"../amua-images/arrow_48.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> after \"Progressive Disease\" in the Mild health state, and then clicking on <img src=\"../amua-images/cost_24.png\" alt=\"Custom Icon\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"/> Add Cost.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nCheck and run the model to obtain Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) results\n:::\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIf the Ministry of Health uses a \\$25,000/QALY
