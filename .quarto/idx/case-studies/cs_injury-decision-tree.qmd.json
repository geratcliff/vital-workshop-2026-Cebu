Fireworks, while culturally ingrained and a source of celebration, pose substantial risks, especially to children. This has led policymakers to consider various strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance public safety.\n\nThe decision problem we will consider revolves around analyzing approaches to reducing injuries and fatalities caused by fireworks. Two primary strategies under consideration are **(1) a complete ban on fireworks** and **(2) heavy regulation**, such as restricted sales licenses and stringent enforcement.\n\nA complete ban aims to eliminate the root cause of injuries by prohibiting the sale, storage, and use of fireworks. This approach seeks to protect public health directly but may face resistance due to its impact on cultural traditions and the livelihoods of vendors.\n\nOn the other hand, heavy regulation involves implementing strict controls over the sale and use of fireworks. This strategy includes measures such as issuing sales licenses only to authorized vendors, enforcing age restrictions, and conducting public education campaigns about the dangers of fireworks. This approach aims to reduce injuries while allowing for controlled, safe use of fireworks.\n\nOur case studies will explore these strategies through two decision modeling approaches. This case study will utilize a decision tree model to evaluate the immediate outcomes and costs associated with each strategy.\n\nLater, we will employ a Markov cohort model to examine the long-term health and economic impacts, considering factors such as injury rates, healthcare costs, and compliance levels.\n\nBy analyzing these models, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the most cost-effective and sustainable approach to reducing gunpowder-related injuries in Colombia today.\n\n# Model Inputs and Parameters\n\n## Injury Rates\n\nYour colleagues have compiled the following data on gunpowder injuries by year in Colombia. We will construct a decision tree model based on injuries in the most recent year reported (2022).\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nlibrary(flextable)\n\n# Create a data frame with the data\nfirework_data <- data.frame(\n  Year = as.character(c(2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)),\n  Cases = c(275, 754, 812, 1061, 1096, 1351, 1407, 848, 2012, 1469, 1778, 1477, 1378, 1504, 1694, 1510),\n  Population = c(42658630, 43134017, 43608630, 44086292, 44553416, 45001731, 45434492, 46301316, 43183988, 46301316, 47419000, 48259442, 49269676, 50407437, 51177378, 51682692),\n  `Rate per 100,000` = c(0.64, 1.75, 1.86, 2.41, 2.46, 3.00, 3.10, 1.83, 4.31, 3.17, 3.75, 3.06, 2.80, 2.98, 3.31, 2.92)\n)\n\n# Create the flextable\nft <- flextable(tail(firework_data ))\n\n# Print the flextable\nft\n```\n\n## Injury Types and Consequences\n\nWe will assume that reported injuries fall into three major categories:\n\n-   **Minor Or Moderate Injury**: First-degree burns, which may cause pain, redness, and minor swelling. This category also includes second-degree burns that cover a more significant portion of the body and involve blisters, pain, and potential infection risk\n\n-   **Major Injury**: third-degree burns or severe trauma that affects deeper tissues and can lead to significant complications.\n\n-   **Fatal Injury**\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\nThere are very likely many minor and moderate injuries that go unreported in official statistics. For this case study, we will assume that severe injuries are 30% of reported injuries.\n:::\n\n| Description                            | Base Case Value    | Parameter Name |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Probability of Injury                  | 0.0000292          | p_injury       |\n| Probability Injury is Severe           | 0.30               | p_severe       |\n| Probability Injury is Mild or Moderate | 0.7 = 1 - p_severe | 1 - p_severe   |\n| Probability Injury is Fatal            | 0.0046             | p_fatality     |\n\nWe will also assume that a small percentage (15%) of individuals with mild/moderate injuries experience long-term consequences (i.e., 85% recover), while the majority (90%) of those with severe injuries do not fully recover and experience long-term complications.\n\n| Description                                   | Base Case Value | Parameter Name    |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Probability of Recovery: Mild/Moderate Injury | 0.85            | p_recover_mildmod |\n| Probability of Recovery: Major Injury         | 0.1             | p_recover_severe  |\n\n## Strategies and Impact\n\nWhen the mayor of Bogota banned the sale of fireworks in 1995, fireworks-related burns fell by 62%, from 204 in the 1994-1995 Christmas season to 77 during the 1995-1996 season.[^1] We will assume a similar 60% relative risk reduction under the \"Ban\" scenario.\n\n[^1]: Source: \"Antanas Mockus: The Prohibition of Fireworks in BogotÃ¡ Sequel,\" *Harvard Kennedy School Case Study.* Available from<https://case.hks.harvard.edu/antanas-mockus-the-prohibition-of-fireworks-in-bogota-sequel/>\n\nBy comparison, we will assume that stricter regulation will reduce firework injuries by just 20%. We will examine the sensitivity of our findings to these assumpions later in the case study.\n\n# Exercises\n\n## 1.1.
