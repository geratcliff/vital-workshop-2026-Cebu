# Learning Objectives and Outline

## Learning Objectives

-   Classify model parameters across different economic perspectives

-   Characterize the data collection approaches for cost-effectiveness studies (i.e., alongside clinical trials versus secondary data collection)

-   Identify resources and tools for collecting both cost and benefit parameters

## Outline

# ICER review {background="#43464B"}

$$
\frac{C_1 - C_0 \quad  (\Delta C)}{E_1 - E_0 \quad  (\Delta E)}
$$

## Numerator (costs)

Valued in monetary terms

<br> - E.g., <br> [\$USD / â‚¦NGN / KES / R]{style="color: #016301"}

## Denominator (benefits):

Valued in terms of **clinical outcomes**

<br> - E.g., <br> [\# of HIV cases prevented]{style="color: #016301"} <br> [\# of children seizure free]{style="color: #016301"} <br> [\# of quality-adjusted life years gained]{style="color: #016301"} <br>

-   What's important for the question at hand
-   Most analyses report several different outcomes
-   QALY/DALYs enable comparability across disease areas

# Perspective matters {background="#43464B"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
## Formal healthcare sector

**Costs:** Medical costs borne by "third-party payers" & paid for out-of-pocket by patients <br> **Benefits:** Health impact to patient & if relevant, family/unpaid caregiver <br>

::: incremental
-   In many countries, this might mean "donor payers" and/or largely out-of-pocket costs by patients.
-   This might also include "program costs" paid for by donor of government entities
-   Ideally, costs from a healthcare sector perspective should include **current + future costs**, related & unrelated to the condition under consideration

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
## Societal perspective

Represents the wider "public interest" & inter-sector distribution of resources that are important to consider <br>

-   Includes patient transportation/travel, non-medical out-of-pocket costs, and time/productivity costs
-   May include family/informal caregiver costs related to transport/travel, non-medical out-of-pocket costs, time/productivity costs <br>

::: incremental
-   **Presenteeism** (i.e., lost productivity when individuals are not fully functional at work due to illness)
-   **Absenteeism** (i.e., time absent from work as a consequence of illness)

# Data collection {background="#43464B"}

## Two approaches:

<br> (1) Alongside [**clinical trials**]{style="color: #00589b;"} <br> (2) Using [**secondary data**]{style="color: #00589b;"}

# 1. Data collection alongside [clinical trials]{style="color: aquamarine;"} {background="#43464B"}

## Costs (clinical trials)

Source: Gold 1996, Drummond 2015, Gray 2012) <br>

1.  **Identify** -- Estimate the different categories of resources likely to be required (e.g., surgical staff, medical equipment, surgical complications, re-admissions) <br> <br>

2.  **Measure** -- Estimate how much of each resource category is required (e.g. type of staff performing the surgery and time involved, post-surgery length of stay, re-admission rates) <br> <br>

3.  **Value** -- Apply unit costs to each resource category (e.g., salary scales from the relevant hospital or national wage rates for staff inputs, cost per inpatient day for the post-surgery hospital stay)

## Effects (clinical trials)

-   Important clinical outcomes of the trial (e.g. cases or deaths averted)
-   If seeking to measure **QALYs** gained, the EQ-5D (an indirect preference-based weight tool) can be obtained in several different languages
    -   visit: [euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/all-eq-5d-versions/]{style="color: blue;"}
    -   Age/proxy requirements can also be found on this site

## Effects (clinical trials)

If seeking to measure **DALYs** averted (DALYs typically utilizes standardized disability weights): <br>

-   **Published Global burden of disease weights** can be used alongside other data points collected in the clinical trial, such as "age of onset of disease."

-   Other data needed to calculate DALYs, such as "life expectancy" due to disease/stages of disease, can also be estimated (more on that in the "secondary data" section)

## Effects (clinical trials)

<br>

> Since disability weights are freely & publicly available (these weights are required for DALY calculations), it can reduce costs/time/resources compared to collecting QALY estimates

## Productivity/time associated costs (clinical trials)

-   **Productivity (presenteeism & absenteeism)** can be measured with validated instruments such as the [Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI)]{style="color: #016301"}, among others published <br><br>
-   Scores from these instruments can be used to estimate the **% of work-related productivity loss**, which can be monetized based on assumptions on population wage and number of hours typically spent working

# 2. Using [secondary]{style="color: aquamarine;"} data only {background="#43464B"}

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
## Costs (secondary data)

(Same approach as for clinical trials above) <br>

1.  **Identify** -- Estimate the different categories of resources (e.g., surgical staff, medical equipment, surgical complications, re-admissions) <br> <br>

2.  **Measure** -- Estimate how much of each resource category is required (e.g. type of staff performing the surgery and time involved, post-surgery length of stay, re-admission rates) <br> <br>

3.  **Value** -- Apply unit costs to each resource category (e.g., salary scales from the relevant hospital or national wage rates for staff inputs, cost per inpatient day for the post-surgery hospital stay)
:::

## Costs (secondary data)

1.  **In country/hospital/donor data registries** - key is to get as close to the "true" cost associated with each procedure per patient
    -   E.g., "TB healthcare & diagnostics are from official price list of the National Health Laboratory Service in South Africa; Costs for follow-up reflect local clinic and culture-based screening for active-tuberculosis"
2.  **Review of published literature**
3.  **Tufts CEA Registry**
4.  **DCP3: Disease Control Priorities**

## Costs (secondary data)

-   Up until now, we focused on **Micro costing** (bottom-up) (e.g., for treatment-specific costs); Identifying & measuring each resource utilized and applying unit costs

-   **Gross costing** (top-down) estimates the cost of an event or condition; can capture important downstream costs (e.g., hospitalizations due to "opioid" relapse/recurrence)

A tool that can convert health outcomes expressed in non-DALY metrics (e.g., cases or deaths averted) into DALYs -- converted DALY measures can then be used to compare cost-effectiveness ratios of interventions across different disease areas (http://ghcearegistry.org/ghcearegistry/)
