# Learning Objectives and Outline

## Learning Objectives

-   Explain the purpose of deterministic sensitivity analysis and
    provide examples of one-way versus two-way analyses.

-   Detail the advantages/disadvantages of deterministic sensitivity
    analysis.

## Outline

1.  Net Benefit Outcome Measures
2.  One-way sensitivity analysis.
3.  Two-way sensitivity analysis.
4.  Limitations and extensions.
5.  Threshold analysis
6.  Scenario analysis

## Alternatives to ICERs

-   ICERs the most common approach for describing CEA results
    -   [Good]{style="color:green"}: summarize all aspects of decision
        problem except WTP (which comes from decision-maker)
    -   [Bad]{style="color:red"}: algorithms a bit complicated, negative
        ICERs, ratios can act poorly when denominator uncertain

## An Alternative

-   If willing to choose a fixed willingness-to-pay threshold (e.g.,
    $\lambda =$ 100,000 / QALY), can write down an equation for the
    contribution of health and cost to utility.
    -   Net Health Benefit (NHB)
    -   Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)
-   [Objective]{style="color:blue"}: Select the strategy with the
    highest NHB/NMB

## Net Health Benefit (NHB)

$$
\text{NHB}_s = E_s - \frac{C_s}{\lambda}
$$ where $E_s$ is effectiveness of strategy $s$, $C_s$ is cost of $s$
and $\lambda$ is WTP threshold.

## Net Health Benefit (NHB)

$$
\text{NMB}_s = E_s \times \lambda - C_s
$$ where $E_s$ is effectiveness of strategy $s$, $C_s$ is cost of $s$
and $\lambda$ is WTP threshold.

## Example: NHB

::: columns
::: column
$E_1$ = 0.07 years

$E_2$ = 0.10 years

$C_1$ = 1,500

$C_2$ = 2,800

$\lambda$ = 50,000 per year of life saved
:::

::: column
$$
ICER = \frac{2800-1500}{0.10 - 0.07}  \\
= 43,333 \\
$$
:::
:::

## Example: NHB

$$
NHB_1 = 0.07 - 1500/50000 = 0.040 \\
NHB_2 = 0.10 - 2800/50000 = 0.044
\\
\text{Incremental } NHB = 0.044 - 0.040 = 0.004
$$

## Example: Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)

$$
NHB_1 = 0.07 \times 50000 - 1500 = 2000 \\
NHB_2 = 0.10 \times 50000 - 2800 = 2200
\\
\text{Incremental } NHB = 2200 - 2000 = 200
$$

## Sensitivity

-   ICER for Prevention strategy is just above WTP threshold of
    \$50,000/QALY.
-   NMB for treatment only slightly above NMB for prevention.
-   How sensitive are these results to changes in specific model inputs?

# One-way sensitivity analysis {background="#43464B"}

## One-way sensitivity analysis

::: incremental
-   Usually the starting point for sensitivity analyses
-   Sequentially testing one variable at a time (i.e., Age, BMI, QALY,
    other clinically important parameters), while holding everything
    else constant
-   Determining how this variation impacts the results
-   One-way sensitivity analyses are often presented in a **tornado
    diagram**
    -   Used to visually rank the different variables in order of their
        overall influence on the magnitude of the model outputs

## Primary Results: Progressive Disease

| Strategy   | ICER    |
|------------|---------|
| Status Quo | \-      |
| Treatment  | 49,513  |
| Prevention | 139,630 |

-   Treatment is cost-effective at WTP=\$50,000/QALY---but *barely.*

-   How sensitive is this result to the input parameter values used?

# Two-way sensitivity analysis {background="#43464B"}

## Two-way sensitivity analysis

::: incremental
-   A way to map the interaction effects between two parameters in a
    decision analysis model
-   Varies 2 parameters at a time
-   Explores the robustness of results in more depth

## HIV prevention

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-28%20at%209.54.01%20AM.png){width="517"}

## HIV prevention

::: incremental
-   Markov model examining strategies for HIV prevention among
    serodiscordant couples seeking conception (woman does not have HIV
    and male has HIV)

-   We know that if the **male partner is consistently on medication for
    HIV** (i.e., resulting in virologic suppression), then the risk of
    transmission is small regardless of the woman taking PrEP
    (pre-exposure prophylaxis)

-   And we also know that PrEP has traditionally been really **costly**

## Financial incentives for acute stroke care

::: incremental
-   Under pay for performance policies in the US, **physicians or
    hospitals are paid more for meeting evidence-based quality targets**

-   Study objective: Illustrate how pay-for-performance incentives can
    be quantitatively bounded using cost-effectiveness modeling, through
    the **application of reimbursement to hospitals for faster
    time-to-tPA for acute ischemic stroke**
:::

## Financial incentives for acute stroke care

> When administered quickly after stroke onset (within three hours, as
> approved by the FDA), tPA helps to restore blood flow to brain regions
> affected by a stroke, thereby limiting the risk of damage and
> functional impairment

# Interactive Amua Session {background="#43464B"}

# Limitations of deterministic sensitivity analyses {background="#43464B"}

## Caution: Limitations!

-   Limited by the subjectivity of the choice of parameters to analyze
-   That's why we also run PSAs!, i.e., varying ALL input parameters at
    the same time, using priors to play a distribution around each value

# Scenario analysis

## Motivation

-   Suppose we wanted to model the impact of these interventions under a
    "lower cost" scenario.
-   One option is to
-   It may be more efficient to define different scenarios rather than
    add additional strategies to the model structure itself.

## Scenario analysis

-   Focuses more on model **assumptions** rather than parameter
    uncertainty
-   Could include separate analysis on:

> Subgroups/sub-populations, including different age cohorts & risk
> levels

<br>

> Different perspectives (societal; modified societal; etc)

## Scenario analysis

> Hypothetical scenarios ("optimistic" and "conservative" scenarios; for
> example, if we have little evidence of long-term survival associated
> with medication X, we might have an optimistic versus conservative
> scenario)

<br>

> Time horizons
