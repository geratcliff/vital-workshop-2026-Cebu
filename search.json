    "text": "Transition Probabilities\nThe underlying transition probability matrix has the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, because we are modeling a cohort of newborns until death, we need to include death transition probabilities that vary by age (i.e., cycle) in the model. In other words, there will be a different death probability in each cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn Amua, time-varying inputs are operationalized as variables  rather than parameters.\nVariables  can be defined to keep track of model events and dynamically update expressions as the model runs. Thus, unlike parameters  which are fixed for a given run of the model, variables can change within a simulation. Variables may change across individuals, allowing heterogeneity to be modeled, or they may change over time.\n\n\nTherefore, we will define p_die as a variable  that references values in a lookup table , following the steps below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA lookup table returns the value that corresponds to a particular index. The first column in a lookup table contains the table indices, and one or more columns of lookup values can be defined. Index values must be unique and in ascending order.\nDepending on how your data are defined, you can use three lookup table methods in Amua:\n\nExact: Returns the value associated with the exact index. Use this only if the index values exactly align with the cycle length (e.g., ages 0, 1, 2, etc. with an annual cycle length). If the exact index is not found the table returns NaN (i.e., a missing value).\nTruncate: Returns a value that is truncated (i.e. floor) for the index. This is a common way to use life-tables that bin ages into ranges. If the supplied index is below the minimum index the table returns NaN.\nInterpolate: Returns a value that is interpolated between indices. Interpolate may be a viable option if you have age-based probabilities defined at the year level, but cycle lengths that are less than a year.\n\nFor details about these methods visit the Amua Wiki on GitHub.\n\n\nWe first define a lookup table  tbl_p_die to read in the age-dependent background mortality constructed from country life tables.\n\nDownload Data\nDownload the background mortality file for your country from the workshop website. Each workbook contains the age-indexed annual mortality probability for various countries represented in our workshop.\n\n\n\nBangladesh\nRwanda\n\n\nCambodia\nSouth Africa\n\n\nCameroon\nSri Lanka\n\n\nChina\nTanzania\n\n\nEthiopia\nThailand\n\n\nIndia\nUganda\n\n\nKenya\nZambia\n\n\nMozambique\nZimbabwe\n\n\nPhilippines\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the first few rows of this .csv file is shown below. Theindexcolumn is the age, whilep_die is the annual probability of death at each age.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the “Tables” panel, click  to add a table, and you should see a “Define Table” window (see screenshot below). Click the Import button  and select the downloaded .csv file to import. The table will automatically be resized to fit the imported data. The first row in the file will be used as table headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAn alternative approach to uploading the .csv is to simply copy and paste the two columns from the .csv file, and then hit the  paste button. You can then paste the table directly into Amua.\n\n\nEnter “tbl_p_die” as the name for this variable. “Lookup” is the default table type (which is what we want here). Choose “Interpolate” as the Lookup Method. Click Save to apply.\n\n\nBackground Mortality\nNext, we can define the time-varying variable p_die (which reads from the table we just defined and operates as the background mortality probability in the current model cycle, \\(t\\)).\nMake sure you create a variable and not a parameter. Under “Variables”, click  to add a variable p_die = tbl_p_die[age_initial + t, 1].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first column of a table is always used for indexing in tables. Therefore, the number “1” here will actually indicate the second column in your table as the corresponding value. You can also use the name of the column to read a value, e.g., tbl_p_die[age_initial + t, “p_die”].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn Amua, “t” is a built-in variable that tracks the number of cycles. It automatically updates when the model runs. For example, in the 10th cycle on the Markov model, t = 10. Therefore, in the formula “tbl_p_die[age_initial + t, 1]”, age_initial + t will equal the modeled age of the individual in cycle t, and the full formula will read the age-dependent background mortality based on the individual’s current age (instead of the initial age).\nAmua defaults to a cycle time of \\(t=0\\). Therefore, if you hit “Evaluate” the Expected Value field should calculate the death probability for a newborn as shown in the .csv lookup table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have all transition probabilities defined. Add these inputs to the branches of the model. Remember to add the complementary probabilities using “C” as well."

    "text": "In Colombia, the issue of firework-related injuries, particularly during festive seasons, remains a significant public health concern. Fireworks, while culturally ingrained and a source of celebration, pose substantial risks, especially to children. This has led policymakers to consider various strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance public safety.\nThe decision problem we will consider revolves around analyzing approaches to reducing injuries and fatalities caused by fireworks. Two primary strategies under consideration are (1) a complete ban on fireworks and (2) heavy regulation, such as restricted sales licenses and stringent enforcement.\nA complete ban aims to eliminate the root cause of injuries by prohibiting the sale, storage, and use of fireworks. This approach seeks to protect public health directly but may face resistance due to its impact on cultural traditions and the livelihoods of vendors.\nOn the other hand, heavy regulation involves implementing strict controls over the sale and use of fireworks. This strategy includes measures such as issuing sales licenses only to authorized vendors, enforcing age restrictions, and conducting public education campaigns about the dangers of fireworks. This approach aims to reduce injuries while allowing for controlled, safe use of fireworks.\nOur case studies will explore these strategies through two decision modeling approaches. This case study will utilize a decision tree model to evaluate the immediate outcomes and costs associated with each strategy.\nLater, we will employ a Markov cohort model to examine the long-term health and economic impacts, considering factors such as injury rates, healthcare costs, and compliance levels.\nBy analyzing these models, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the most cost-effective and sustainable approach to reducing gunpowder-related injuries in Colombia today."

    "text": "Add Health States and Transitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd in the relevant health states and transitions for the progressive disease model. Don’t worry yet about transition probabilities and other parameters—just get the Markov structure complete.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you reach the end of the branch, select the chance node you would like to turn into a state transition, right click, select Change to State Transition. This will give you the blue arrow  . On the right of this arrow, you can find a dropdown menu with the different health states you specified. Select the health state this part of the cohort will transition to.\nWith this button  you can align the end nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is common practice in teaching decision modeling to model events sequentially. Suppose, for example, that an individual can experience the following events from a diseased state:\n-   Die from disease (Event A)\n-   Die from background causes (Event B)\n-   Survive\nThe image below shows two alternative approaches to modeling these events. Panel A uses a non-sequential approach in which events in a cycle are not conditional on other events not occurring. Panel B, by comparison, first considers death from Event A. Conditional on surviving A, it then considers death from Event B.\n\nIf you are converting rates to probabilities using standard formulas (e.g., \\(1-\\exp(-r)\\)) you should use a sequential approach where only two events are considered at at time (Panel B). This ensures that the converted probabilities work correctly.\nIf you are using transition probabilities derived from embedding the transition probabilities from the underlying transition rate matrix, as we covered in lecture, you do not need to undertake the sequential approach: you can use the approach in Panel A, though you will also need to make sure that your model structure captures all non-zero probabilities in your transition probability matrix.\nFor the remainder of this case study we will model the disease progression using the sequential approach (e.g., the approach in Panel B).\n\n\n\nYour Markov model should now look like this:"

    "text": "Define Transition Probabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the parameter values above to define and add transition probabilities to the Markov model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, you will need to define some parameter tables and variables that draw on age-based transition probabilities, just as you did for the alive-dead model. For these transition probabilities, remember to enter them as Variables rather than Parameters. Refer to the Alive-Dead case study for instructions on how to index a transition probability to the current age in the model.\nBecause transition probabilities are not defined for each age in the model, you will need to specify the “Truncate” option in Amua when defining the table. This will allow Amua to draw on the next closest age when assigning the transition probability. A screenshot for a table defined for the disease onset probabilities is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nAfter inputting the transition probabilities, your Markov model should look like this:\n\n\nSanity Check: Life Expectancy\nIt’s often useful to occasionally stop and validate that your model does not have any errors in it before moving on to the next step. For this sanity check, let’s verify that we can obtain the same life expectancy as in the simple alive-dead model. In other words, we’ll allow people to cycle among the various healthy and diseased health states. However, we will (temporarily) rule out the possibility of disease-related death. By calculating life expectancy as the primary outcome, we “reward” all health states (healthy, mild, progressive disease) with a payoff value of 1.0. Thus, even though our model is more complicated, we should obtain the same overall life expectancy value as a simple alive-dead model.\nTo do this, make the following changes:\n\nMake sure that the life expectancy “payoff” (“LE”) is set to 1 for all health states in which an individual remains alive (Healthy, Mild, Progressive).\nTemporarily set the probability of disease-related death (p_death_disease) to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these changes made, check and run the model. You should obtain a life expectancy value of 77.0449."

For example, death from disease carries a one-time cost (c_death_disease). We will add this cost by assigning a one-time cost at the time an individual transitions to the Death (Disease) state from the Progressive disease state. You can add this one-time cost by right-clicking on the transition node  after “Dead (Disease)” in the Progressive Disease health state, and then clicking on  Add Cost."

    "text": "Step 5: Construct the Markov Trace for the NH Strategy\nUse the transition probability matrix to fill out the Markov trace for the NH strategy.\nOur objective here is to fill out the Markov trace, which is the table that tracks the cohort as it moves through the various health states over time. In principle, we could track a cohort of any size (e.g., 100,000 people; 1,000,000 people, etc.). However, to simplify calculations of the average cost and health outcomes, we will model a cohort of size 1.0. You can see this in the first row of the Markov trace—this row shows that our model will start with a cohort of 1 patient who begins in the “Healthy” state.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou objective here is to fill in each row of the Markov trace. To do this, you must multiply the fraction of the cohort in each state by the transition probability for that state. For example, in the first row, we have 1.0 patients in the Healthy state. Suppose the transition probability from Healthy to Healthy is 0.95. In that case, the number of patients who will remain in the Healthy state in the next cycle is 1.0 x 0.95 = 0.95.\nSimliarly, suppose the transition probability for Healthy -&gt; Sick is 0.05. In that case, the number of patients who will transition from Healthy to Sick in the next cycle is 1.0 x 0.05 = 0.05.\nThe trick here is to incorporate all the possible transitions into each state. For example, in each cycle, the DeathBG state must include all transitions from Healthy -&gt; DeathBG, Sick -&gt; DeathBG, and Sicker -&gt; DeathBG, as well as all the individuals who remain in the death state (i.e., DeathBG -&gt; DeathBG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can fill out each cycle’s values using formulas that refer to the previous cycle’s values. For example, the value for Healthy in cycle \\(t=2\\) can be calculated using the formula:\nHealthy[t=2]=Healthy[t=1]*Pr(Healthy-&gt;Healthy)+Sick[t=1]*Pr(Sick-&gt;Healthy)+Sicker[t=1]*Pr(Sicker -&gt; Healthy)+DeadBG[t=1]*Pr(DeadBG -&gt; Healthy)+DeadDisease[t=1]*Pr(DeadDisease-&gt;Healthy). Note that some of these probabilities will be zero, as shown in the transition probability matrix.\nThis formula takes the value for Healthy in cycle 1 and multiplies it by the transition probability for Healthy -&gt; Healthy. It then adds the value for Sick in cycle 1 multiplied by the transition probability for Sick -&gt; Healthy, and so on."

    "section": "Step 8: Calculate Adjusted Cycle Outcomes",
    "text": "Step 8: Calculate Adjusted Cycle Outcomes\nThese steps will be covered live as a group.\n\nCycle Costs\nCycle costs are calculted by multiplying the cycle value for each health state by its associated cost payoff. For example, if the cost of a cycle in the Healthy state is 5 and the value for Healthy in a given cycle is 0.25 (i.e., 25% of the cohort is in the Healthy state for the cycle), the Healthy costs for the cycle would be 5 * 0.25 = 1.25. We can similarly calculate the costs for the other health states in the cycle. The sum of these costs, multiplied by the cycle adjustment factor, is the adjusted total cost for the cycle.\n\n\nCycle QALYs\nCycle QALYs are constructed much like costs. The only exception is that we multiply by the utility weight rather than the cost for the given health state. Remember to also multiply by the total adjustment factor for the cycle, in order to obtain discounted and cycle-adjusted total QALYs.\n\n\nCycle YLDs\nCycle QALYs are constructed much like costs. The only exception is that we multiply by the disability weight rather than the cost for the given health state. Remember to also multiply by the total adjustment factor for the cycle, in order to obtain discounted and cycle-adjusted total YLDs.\n\n\nCycle YLLs\n\nWe begin with remaining (undiscounted) life expectancy at each cycle, which is based on the age of the cohort at the beginning of each cycle, and drawn from the reference life table published by the GBD.\nPer the GBD formulas and WHO guidance (which recommends discounting health outcomes in CEAs), we next discount the remaining life expectancy at each cycle so that it reflects the present value of remaining life expectancy. This is done using the following continuous time discounting formula: (1/r_ann) * (1 - EXP(-r_ann * LE)), where r_ann is the annual discount rate (e.g., 3%) and LE is the value for undiscounted remaining life expectancy for the cycle.\nNext, we must determine the total number/fraction of the cohort that dies due to CVD-related causes in each cycle. This is done by subtracting the value for DeadDisease in the previous cycle from the value for DeadDisease in the current cycle. For example, if the value for DeadDisease in cycle 1 is 0.05 and the value for DeadDisease in cycle 2 is 0.10, then the number/fraction of the cohort who die due to CVD-related causes in cycle 2 is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05.\nTo calculate the YLLs, we multiply the discounted remaining life expectancy value by the number/fraction of the cohort who die due to CVD-related causes in the cycle. These are the values we calculated directly above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo calculate YLLs, we must also apply the half cycle correction to ensure more accurate total values. Note that we do NOT apply the total cycle correction factor (which we applied to the cost, QALY, and YLD outcomes) because we already applied discounting in Step 2 above."

We will ignore these changes for the sake of simplicity. This simplifying assumption means that we are fitting a “time-homogeneous” model.

There’s still an opportunity cost associated with this but it’s from the perspective of the goods & services we would be willing to forego for these additional health gains.\nSimilarly, another way that countries have looked at the threshold is in terms of per capita consumption - consistent with the idea that people living in countries with higher incomes are able and willing to pay more for health - which makes intuitive sense"
